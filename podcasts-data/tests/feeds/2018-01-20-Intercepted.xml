      <title>BONUS: All The News Unfit to Print</title>
      <description>James Risen is a legend in the world of investigative and national security journalism. As a reporter for the New York Times, Risen broke some of the most important stories of the post 9/11 era, from the warrantless surveillance against Americans conducted under the Bush-Cheney administration, to black prison sites run by the CIA, to failed covert actions in Iran. Risen has won the Pulitzer and other major journalism awards. But perhaps what he is now most famous for is fighting a battle under both the Bush and Obama administrations as they demanded — under threat of imprisonment —the name of one of Risen’s alleged confidential sources. But it isn’t just the government that Risen had to fight. He also battled his own editors and other powerful figures at the New York Times. Risen is now a senior national security correspondent at The Intercept where his incredible inside story has now been published. We talk with Risen about his career at the New York Times in a special edition of Intercepted.</description>

      <description>Nothing brings warmongers, hawks and elites from both parties closer than a cruise missile strike. This week’s Intercepted will piss off Assad supporters and the Democrats and Republicans fawning over Trump’s newest war.

And, Maher Arar is a Syrian-born Canadian engineer who was kidnapped at JFK airport by US operatives after 9/11 and rendered to Syria and tortured by Assad’s agents. Arar says he opposes Assad and US intervention. All that and a bucket of media stupidity to celebrate beautiful missiles.</description>

      <description>The first contestant in Donald Trump’s reality administration has left the West Wing.
