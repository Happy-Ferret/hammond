        <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to The Tip Off- the podcast where we take you behind the scenes of some of the best investigative journalism from recent years. Each episode we’ll be digging into an investigative scoop- hearing from the journalists behind the work as they tell us about the leads, the dead-ends and of course, the tip offs. There’ll be car chases, slammed doors, terrorist cells, meetings in dimly lit bars and cafes, wrangling with despotic regimes and much more. So if you’re curious about the fun, complicated detective work that goes into doing great investigative journalism- then this is the podcast for you.</p>]]></description>

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Ep.9 When the roof came down In late July I read a Facebook post that would send me on a three month journey- from town council steps, to bland hotels to dirty council flats- I followed the stories of women fleeing domestic violence only to be let down by the system designed to support them. Meanwhile, a team of journalists all across the country, dug into FOI data, pulled in local council funding bids and surveyed experts on the ground. Together we uncovered a country-wide crisis, with huge cuts to refuge funding and hundreds of vulnerable women turned away.
