      <title>Glenn Greenwald on the New Cold War</title>
      <description>With all the constant hype about Russia, you’d think we were living in a new Cold War. This week on Intercepted: Glenn Greenwald fills in for Jeremy Scahill, and we take a deep dive into the origins and evolution of the Trump-Russia story. Fox News' Tucker Carlson and Glenn find something they can actually agree on (the Democratic establishment’s Russia hysteria), but diverge on Tucker’s coverage of immigration and crime. Russian-American writer Masha Gessen explains how conspiracy thinking is a mirror of the leaders we put in power.</description>

      <description>The clock struck thirteen on January 20, Donald Trump is the president of the United States and episode one of Intercepted is here. Intercept co-founder Glenn Greenwald and editor-in-chief Betsy Reed join Jeremy Scahill for a discussion on the crazy apocalyptic present. They break down Trump’s attacks on the media, that insane speech he gave at the CIA and the state of the Democratic party. Naomi Klein sends in a dispatch from the Women’s March on Washington. Jeremy goes deep into the secretive world of Seymour Hersh’s kitchen, and shoots the shit with the legendary Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist about why he calls Trump a “circuit breaker." And we hear a spoken word performance from hip-hop artist Immortal Technique.&amp;nbsp;</description>
